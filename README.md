# js-ui-sandbox

Welcome to **js-ui-sandbox** — a creative space where I build and experiment with modern UI components using plain JavaScript (Vanilla JS), CSS, and HTML.

This repository serves as a personal lab to learn, test, and showcase frontend concepts such as:

- Dynamic UI interactions
- Responsive design techniques
- Custom components (modals, tabs, dropdowns, sliders, etc.)
- Event handling & DOM manipulation
- State management in Vanilla JS
- Modern CSS practices

##  Tech Stack
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, Variables)
